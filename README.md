# Level-UP (Ruby Edition)

 Level-UP is a full-stack Ruby on Rails web application designed to help users build habits through gamification. The app allows users to track daily tasks and habits while earning XP and leveling up as they progress, making self-improvement more engaging and rewarding. This is actually a simple minimalistic remake of my original Level-UP web app developed with Flask and React.js. This project enhanced my skills in Ruby on Rails, database design, and user experience optimization while aligning with my passion for building tools that empower users to achieve their goals.
